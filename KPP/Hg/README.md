# KPP/Hg -- folder for the GEOS-Chem mercury chemistry mechanism

This folder contains the files that define the mercury chemistry 
mechanism for GEOS-Chem.

## User-modifiable configuration files

  1. **Hg.kpp**: Master KPP specification file.

  2. **Hg.eqn**: KPP equation file, contains reaction definitoins.

  3. **Hg_HetStateFuncs.F90**: This module contains functions
     that initialize the HetChem state object. 
    
  5. **Hg_RateLawFuncs.F90**: This module contains functions
	 that compute rates for heterogenous chemistry reactions.  This is
	 the so-called "rate law library" for the fullchem mechanism.
	 
  6. **rateLawUtilFuncs.F90**: This module contains several utility
     functions for heterogeneous chemistry reactions.  (Symbolic link
     to ../fullchem/rateLawUtilfuncs.
 
## Files generated by KPP-for-GEOS-Chem

With the exception of the symbolic link gckpp.kpp, all files starting
with the prefix "gckpp_" are generated by KPP-for-GEOS-Chem.  These
contain the specifications of the chemical mechanism in efficient
source code.
